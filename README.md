  - Pressure
- Simple UI built with Streamlit
- Runs entirely in-browser

## 🧠 How It Works

- Trained a Random Forest Regressor on open-source weather data
- Cleaned and preprocessed with pandas
- Built and deployed using Streamlit Cloud

## 💡 Challenge Goal

To empower local communities to forecast weather conditions when national services are unavailable or delayed due to budget/staffing issues.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- Streamlit
